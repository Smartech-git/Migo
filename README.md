**Migo**

A simple object tracking using HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors is cool.
Migo, a tripod robot uses three ultrasonic sensors to track lateral changes in the x-axis and as well z-axis, with these differentials Migo in "follow-up" mode, moves left or right, forwards or backward, hence tracking an object placed in front of it. A typical illustration is ducklings following a duck.

effective distance range: 0 – 70cm

effective lateral angle range: 60 degrees

effective object size: > 100cm²

processor: Arduino
